### Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The customer first applies for a home loan and after that company validates the customer's eligibility for a loan.  The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customer segments that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.
